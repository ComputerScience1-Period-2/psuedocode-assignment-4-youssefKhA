the players sit around a table or on the ground in a closed regular shaped group, minumum of 2 players
the deck is cut by anyone of the players, and each played is handed the top 4 cards from the deck by the dealer, which can be anyone other than the person who cut the deck, and dealer has to stay the dealer for the rest of the round
each player puts down or takes up a card or cards until all players have used their 4 cards, and then they are handed out another 4 cards
4 cards are put down face up and the players get points by haveing a card that is the sum of any number of cards on the playing surface, (ex: if there is a 1, 1, and a 2 on the playing surface, if a player has a 4 and it is their turn they could take the 1 1 and 2 since they add up to 4
the players take turns by going either clockwise or counter clockwise with the dealer being the last one to play and the last one to be dealt their cards
if there is a single card on the playing surface, and a player has the same cards and it is their turn, the may take the card and set it aside from their normal stack of cards won, as ACEs count as double
same goes if the addition of 2 or 3 cards add up to one number (if there is a 1, a 4, and a 5, and the player hsa a 10, it would be considered an "ACE"
jacks are like vaccum cleaners if you have one they suck up everything on the playing surface that has not already been taken by other players and gets addded to your stack of won cards
queens and kings can count has any number you choose
keep playing until you run out of cards from the deck
