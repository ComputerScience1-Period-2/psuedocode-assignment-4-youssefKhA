the players sit around a table or on the ground in a closed regular shapeed group, minumum of 2 players
the deck is cut (split into 2 halfs) by anyone of the players, and each player is handed the next 4 cards from the top of the bottom half of the deck by the dealer, which can be anyone other than the person who cut the deck, and dealer has to stay the dealer for the rest of the round
If a jack is the bottom card of the top half of the cut deck, it is put as the very last card in the bottom deck
each player puts down or takes up a card or cards until all players have used their 4 cards, and then they are handed out another 4 cards
4 cards are put down on the playing groud face up and the players get points by haveing a card that is the sum of any number of cards on the playing surface, (ex: if there is a 1, 1, and a 2 on the playing surface, if a player has a 4 and it is their turn they could take the 1 1 and 2 since they add up to 4
the players take turns by going either clockwise or counter clockwise with the dealer being the last one to and play and the last one to be dealt their cards
if there is a single card on the playing surface, and a player has the same cards and it is their turn, the may take the card and set it aside from their normal stack of cards won, as ACEs count as double
same goes if the addition of 2 or 3 cards add up to one number (if there is a 1, a 4, and a 5, and the player hsa a 10, it would be considered an "ACE"
jacks are like vaccum clears if yu have one they suck up everything on the playing surface that has not already been taken by other players and gets addded to your stack of won cards
keep playing until you run out of cards from the deck
to count point, every two cards count as a point and every ACE counts as ten points
The person who gets to 210 points first wins
if no player gets to 210 points start a new round
